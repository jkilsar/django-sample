# Django Sample for OBuilds

This project was created as a Django tutorial for review by OBuilds. The BTRE project is a simple real estate application that allows
for users to search for different properties and to submit inquiries to the assigned realtor.

Users also have the ability to create accounts.



## Documentation

The main app for this project is 'btre'. The app connects to a local PostgresSQL server to store data. If required I can change the data source to sql-lite if desired.

I also used a virtual environment to run this application.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

# Django Sample for OBuilds

This project was created as a Django tutorial for review by OBuilds.



## Documentation

The main app for this project is 'btre'. The app connects to a local PostgresSQL server to store data. If required I can change the data source to sql-lite if desired.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
